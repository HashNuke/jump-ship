## Requirements

* Intel Galileo (or any Arduino board)
* Chrome app
* Two wires
* and something to jump on :)


## Setup

* Burn the `ino` program to your Intel Galileo board.
* Open the Chrome app and choose your port


## Notes taken during the hackathon

* Intel Cloud Analytics dashboard - <http://dashboard.us.enableiot.com>
* Cloud Analytics API could not be used because Galileo's WiFi module's connection stability at the venue


## TODO

* Start the game with 2 jumps
* Document circuit (well just about saying where to plug the 2 wires)
